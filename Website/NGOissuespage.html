            <h2>Animal Birth Control (ABCs)</h2>
            <span></span>
            <p> A study of the ABC-AR programme and a comparison with the earlier catch-and-kill procedure conclusively shows the success and feasibility of the
                former in both the control of the street dog population and the incidence of rabies in dogs and humans.  - Dr. S. Chinny Krishna <br>
                <br> The bond between humans and dogs began somewhere on the Eurasian continent 1214,000 years ago, where the first mutual relationship was born. 
                Approaching early human camps and settlements, food scraps are provided, and wolves quickly become frequently welcomed visitors, warning humans 
                of imminent danger and later hunting wildlife. Helped. This started the domestication of dogs and the creation of a human-animal connection that 
                is second to none. Today, humans overbreed dogs  and then abandon them in large numbers, breaking this bond, putting danger to the dogs themselves 
                and putting significant health risks to human society. Too often, authorities facing the problems caused by these dogs turn to mass destruction in 
                the hope of  a quick solution, but realize that  destruction must continue every year  with no end in sight. increase. In addition, by temporarily 
                reducing  the number of stray dogs,  authorities have improved the  survival potential of the remaining dogs and created new opportunities for newly 
                abandoned dogs. It is now recognized that removing extra dogs cannot solve the problem without combining it with other means such as dog registration,
                contraceptive surgery and  public education. <br>
                <br>At  certain population densities, birth rates and mortality rates are equal, the population is in equilibrium, and population growth is flat. 
                This more realistic explanation of population growth is known as logistic growth. The upper limit for population growth to level off is known as 
                carrying capacity. Each habitat has a specific load-bearing capacity for each species. This particular carrying capacity basically depends on the 
                availability, distribution, and quality of the resources of each species (shelter, food, water). Population densities of higher vertebrates 
                (including dogs) are almost always close to carrying capacity. The decrease in population density due to additional mortality is quickly offset 
                by better breeding and better survival potential. In other words, if the dog is taken away, the life expectancy of the survivor will be longer. 
                This is because dogs have better access to resources and  less competition for resources.<br>
                <br>In 1964, frightened by the horrifying method of killing a stray dog ​​by the  Madras Corporation, VELIFEM began investigating the matter. 
                We were surprised to learn that  Madras Corporation, one of the oldest companies in the world, started a capture and killing program in 1860 at
                the age of 300. Section 218 of the Madras  Municipal  Act of 1919 allowed the capture and killing of dogs on unlicensed streets. NS. Former 
                Postmaster of Tamil Nadu, Theodore Baskaran, explains: .. "And a purse-made from dog fur" (5). Since then, the number of dog killings by businesses 
                has continued to increase. Similarly, the number of dogs on the street and  the number of deaths from human rabies.<br>
